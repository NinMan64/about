NintendoMan64 Productions is a Passion 
Project of mine, used for software and
Media. This Company will probably someday
rebrand as Kioneer Company LTD, maybe when
i'm 25 (lol!)

The NinMan64 Cydia Repo is (for now) a
home for the QMole Packages, since
qmole.uk is down. There could be some packages non-Linux Related, maybe even some of my own packages, who knows!!!

The NinMan64 Official YouTube Channel
(@nm64-1) is a passion project of itself, reviewing tech and doing stuff on other stuff, as well as day-to-day extras!

# Q&A Time!
# What's the website for?
idk, maybe tutorials and cydia repos???

# Why NinMan64?
before i had my first Phone (Nokia 2.4), i looked for a game that is Mario-related (i didn't even know that i was a Mario fan then) on my grandmother's phone (a knockoff Vivo Phone) and i came across Super Mario Run. soon i had my first phone, and created my very own Nintendo Account, and the nickname i used was ninman64 (or i like "Nintendo", I'm a "man", and my favourite number, "64".) I later renamed "ninman64" to "NinMan64".

# Is this my first channel?
No, actually. i once had another Channel, and it's literally my name (Kian Hope Barlas) and the last thing i remember about that is me unboxing some random Iron Man Toy (CRINGE!!!) too bad the channel was deleted because i had poorental controls on (Darn Google.)

# When did i get into technology?
I got in when i came across this app that changed the boot screen, and it kept failing because i didn't have root. And the rest is history. (P.S. Maybe YouTubers had influenced me, like DetroitBorg, Michael MJD, and MrWhosetheboss helped.)
